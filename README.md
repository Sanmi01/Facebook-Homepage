# WEJAPA INTERNSHIP

# Result
This is our first time collaborating together
as front-end beginners. The Facebook Homepage was recreated by the team. 
Every part of the page was recreated just the way it was built, but there is no functionality.
The page is hosted on GitHub pages.


# Appreciation 
We are grateful to the management, admins, and mentors of WEJAPA.
We appreciate every bit of opportunity given to beginners like us. 
From the onset of not knowing anything about coding to the provision of resources by WEJAPA, and then to the completion of this project, we are glad of how far we have come. 
Thank you.
